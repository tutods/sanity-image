# Sanity Image URL Builder

[![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@tutods/sanity-url-builder?label=version&color=brightGreen&logo=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tutods/sanity-url-builder) [![Open issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tutods/sanity-image)](https://github.com/tutods/sanity-image/issues) [![github](https://img.shields.io/badge/Original%20Code-coreyward-blue?style=flat)](https://github.com/coreyward/sanity-image/)

This repository is a fork of [Sanity Image from **@coreyward**](https://github.com/coreyward/sanity-image/) but with a different structure. In this case, I transform the repo into a monorepo, allowing to have the utils logic, like `buildSrc`, `buildSrcSet`, etc. separated from the **React** component created by [**@coreyward**](https://github.com/coreyward).

## üìù To Do list
- [x] `buildSrc`, `buildSrcSet` and `buildSvgAttributes` util;
  - These utils are copied directly from [**@coreyward**](https://github.com/coreyward) repository.
- [ ] Implement image component to be used on **SolidJS**;
