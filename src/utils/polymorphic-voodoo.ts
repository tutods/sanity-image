// Big thank you to Ben Ilegbodu for writing this up. It's not the first place

// If you want to understand this code and you are not a TS jedi, check out Ben‚Äôs
// excellent write up on the topic, from which I shamelessly copied 100% of this
// code. I actually [mostly] understand it, and you can too! ü§ì
